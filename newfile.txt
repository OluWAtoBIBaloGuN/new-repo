This work took a look at the emission problem in Lagos state from vehicular activities. 
CO2 emissions are a source of grave danger to any community and data shows that the rate 
of emission in Lagos state is on the high side occasioned by certain factors. 
The State has over time come up with different measures to address this issue but the 
economic realities of vehicle owners and users seem to have a stronger foot in the matter. 
This work therefore tries to mitigate this problem from an Artificial intelligence point 
of view by inculcating the use of two supervised deep learning Neural networks for the purpose 
of prediction and classification with already existing ANPR cameras used for the purpose of identifying 
vehicles with expired papers of those that flout traffic rules. The expanded framework not only meets 
the goals set out but further analysis shows that it comes with other added advantages.
